    text: "This app is designed to provide a simple way to manually control any parameters using either CV or MIDI CC. The MIDI channel and CC numbers can be adjusted in the app's settings, and both MIDI and CV outputs are always active simultaneously. The range can be adjusted using Shift + Fader, which affects both CC and CV ranges. The fader controls the level of the CV or CC. The button behavior is set by the Button mode parameter: Mute toggles the output on and off; CC toggle sends a CC value that alternates between 0 and 127; CC momentary sends 127 while held and 0 on release; Program Change sends a MIDI Program Change message on press using the Button CC / PC number as the program number—useful for switching presets on external devices. The fader level and the mute state can be saved in scenes if the 'Store state' parameter is enabled (active by default). You can then use this app as a way to save and recall CV voltage allowing for preset in a modular system for example. The curve can be adjusted in the settings; however, this only affects the CV output. Two voltage ranges are available in the settings: 0V to 10V or -5V to 5V. Note that this range also affects the level at which CV and CC are set when muting. In the 0V to 10V range, mute is at 0V and CC 0, making it ideal for controlling volume, send levels, or similar parameters. In the -5V to 5V range, mute is at 0V and CC 64, making it suitable for controlling panning, crossfading, or similar functions. The mute behavior can be set to trigger on press or on release, depending on your preference. Due to popular demand, the app's action can also be inverted—this means that when the fader is at the top, the output will be set to the minimum value, and when at the bottom, it will send the maximum CC and CV value. As with all apps where the LED color does not serve any specific function, you are free to configure it in the settings.",

    text: `LFO is a multi-shape oscillator with manually selectable waveforms. Press the button to cycle through shapes; the LED color shows the active waveform: sine (yellow), triangle (pink), ramp down (cyan), ramp up (red), square (white).

#### Speed and range

The fader sets the LFO rate. In free-running mode, speed ranges from 14 Hz down to one cycle per minute. **Shift + Fader** adjusts output attenuation, reducing the CV amplitude. The **Speed** parameter applies a global multiplier—Normal, Slow (÷2), Slowest (÷4)—that works in both free-running and clocked modes.

#### Clocked mode

**Shift + long press** toggles between free-running and tempo-synced modes. When clocked, the available resolutions are: 16th, 8thT, 8th, 4thT, 4th, 2nd, note, half bar, and bar. The button flashes in sync with the LFO rate. **Shift + short press** resets the LFO phase to zero. **Long press** (no shift) mutes the output.

#### Grid Lock

**Grid Lock only has an effect in clocked mode.** When enabled (default on), the LFO phase is continuously derived from the clock's absolute tick count. The phase is always correct relative to the clock grid regardless of when the LFO was started or reset. Changing the speed division re-aligns to the new grid automatically, but this can cause a click as the LFO jumps to its recalculated position.

A **Shift + short press** offsets the phase reference to the current tick, drifting the LFO out of phase with the grid for creative offset effects. A clock reset re-locks to the grid.

Disabling Grid Lock reverts to free-running phase accumulation: the LFO will smoothly speed up or slow down from its current position when the division changes, with no jump.

#### Output

The output range is configured in the parameters: bipolar (−5V to +5V) or unipolar (0V to 10V). This also sets the MIDI CC center—64 for bipolar, 0 for unipolar. MIDI channel and CC number are freely configurable.`,

Shift + Button 2 switches between modes: AD (yellow), ASR (blue), and looping AD (pink). Shift + Button 1 provides a manual trigger, Shift + Fader 1 sets the trigger-to-gate timing, and Shift + Fader 2 controls attenuation. Long press on Button 2 (no shift) mutes the envelope output. The envelope can also be triggered via MIDI, with the MIDI channel set in the parameters. An internal trigger-to-gate converter defines how long the gate stays active, ranging from 0 to 4 seconds—at maximum time, the gate remains on indefinitely. This timing behaves differently depending on the selected envelope mode: in AD mode, it prevents retriggering until the timer runs out; in ASR mode, it holds the envelope for the set duration; and in looping AD mode, it loops the envelope for the timer duration, with infinite looping at maximum time, effectively turning it into an LFO. MIDI note triggering is supported on a user-defined channel, allowing you to save channels by using MIDI directly instead of relying on a MIDI-to-CV gate. The 'MIDI retrigger' parameter allow for the envelope to be retriggered when MIDI notes are overlapping",

CV/Gate outputs are paired per sequencer: jacks 1&2 for sequencer 1, 3&4 for sequencer 2, 5&6 for sequencer 3, and 7&8 for sequencer 4. Faders set note values, buttons define the gate pattern, and **long button presses** enable legato between steps. CV output is quantized to the scale set in the global quantizer.\n\n#### Shift mode\n\nWith Shift held, all 8 faders control settings for the currently selected sequencer:\n\n- **Fader 1** — step length (1–16 steps)\n- **Fader 2** — gate length\n- **Fader 3** — octave offset (0–5 octaves)\n- **Fader 4** — sequence range (1–5 octaves)\n- **Fader 5** — clock resolution (32ndT, 32nd, 16thT, 16th, 8thT, 8th, 4thT, 4th)\n- **Fader 6** — direction (Forward / Backward / Ping-Pong / Random)\n- **Fader 7** — trigger probability (5%–100%)\n- **Fader 8** — 303-style slide time (0 = instant)\n\nTop LEDs show sequence length. Resolution LED color: **orange** = triplet division, **blue** = straight division.\n\n#### Muting tracks\n\n**Shift + long press** on an even button (0, 2, 4, or 6) mutes the corresponding track (1–4). While muted, gates and CV are suppressed and the top and position LEDs turn off; the gate pattern remains visible so the sequence can still be edited. Mute state is saved per scene.\n\n#### MIDI transposition\n\nEach track can be live-transposed via incoming MIDI. Assign a dedicated transpose MIDI channel per track in the parameters. Receiving a NoteOn on that channel shifts the track's output relative to **C4** — middle C = no change, notes above/below transpose up/down by semitones. Transposition applies to both CV and MIDI output.\n\n#### Velocity lane mode (tracks 2 and 4)\n\nWhen enabled, a track acts as a velocity lane for its paired primary track (track 2 → track 1, track 4 → track 3):\n\n- **Fader** — controls the MIDI velocity sent to the paired track, not a note value\n- **CV output** — unquantized voltage proportional to fader position (0–10V)\n- **Gate button** — controls whether velocity advances on that step (on) or holds the previous value (off)\n- MIDI notes are suppressed on the velocity lane track itself",

    text: "A probabilistic sequencer inspired by the Turing machine concept in modular synthesis. A shift register of up to 16 bits evolves over time based on a probability setting, generating melodic and rhythmic patterns that can stay fixed, drift slowly, or change continuously. CV output is always active and quantized to the global quantizer scale. MIDI CC or MIDI notes can be sent simultaneously.\n\n#### Probability\n\nThe **fader** controls the likelihood of bit flips on each clock tick:\n\n- **Bottom** — no flips, the sequence repeats identically\n- **Middle** — 50/50 chance per step, maximum randomness\n- **Top** — constant flips; the effective sequence length also doubles\n\nThe top LED brightness reflects the current output level. A white flash on the bottom LED marks the start of each sequence cycle.\n\n#### Mute\n\nA **short press** (without Shift) toggles mute. When muted, the CV output holds its last value rather than dropping to 0, and the button LED turns off. Mute state is saved per scene.\n\n#### Sequence length\n\nHold **Shift** and press the button once per step to record a new length. Each press increments the count; releasing Shift commits it. For example: hold Shift, press three times, release → 3-step sequence. The sequence register and length are both saved per scene.\n\n#### Clock resolution\n\nHold the **button** and move the **fader** to set the clock resolution: 32ndT, 32nd, 16thT, 16th, 8thT, 8th, 4thT, 4th. While adjusting, the bottom LED shows the division type — **orange** for triplets, **blue** for straight.\n\n#### Shift layer\n\nHolding **Shift** activates a second fader layer. The fader now controls **attenuation**, which reduces the CV output range and — in Gate Out mode — doubles as a gate density control. The top LED turns red and reflects the attenuation level.\n\n#### Gate Out mode\n\nWhen **Gate Out** is enabled in the parameters, the output jack outputs a gate signal instead of CV. Two sub-modes are available, toggled at runtime with **Shift + Long press**:\n\n- **Threshold mode** (default, button LED **yellow** while Shift held) — gate fires when the register value falls below the attenuation level. Higher attenuation = fewer gates; lower attenuation = denser gates.\n- **Bit mode** (button LED **blue** while Shift held) — gate fires when the output bit of the shift register is high, producing rhythmic patterns locked to the register’s content. The attenuation level has no effect in this mode.\n\nIn Gate Out mode, MIDI sends the **Base Note** parameter on each gate-on event rather than a quantized pitch.",

The selected range’s bipolarity also determines the CV and CC values when muted: in the 0V to 10V range, mute corresponds to 0V and CC 0—ideal for volume or send level control—while in the -5V to 5V range, mute is at 0V and CC 64, making it better suited for panning or crossfading. An internal LFO enables autopanning or auto crossfading by modulating the pan level set by Fader 2. The modulation amount is controlled with Shift + Fader 2, LFO speed with Button 2 + Fader 2, and the waveform is selected using Shift + Button 2.",

In speed mode, incoming CV offsets the speed setting. In free-running mode this changes the internal interval, and in clocked mode it offsets the selected timing-resolution index.

Channel 2 is the random output lane: Fader 2 sets base speed, **Shift + Fader 2** sets attenuation, and **Button 2 + Fader 2** sets slew. A **short press** (no Shift) on Button 2 mutes/unmutes output, and **Shift + long press** toggles free-running versus clocked mode.

Output range can be unipolar (0–10V) or bipolar (-5V to +5V), and MIDI CC follows the same random output stream.`,

    text: `LFO+ extends the standard LFO with an assignable CV input on the first channel.

#### CV input

The fader attenuates the incoming CV; the button mutes it. Use **Shift + Button 1** to cycle through CV destinations, shown by the button color:

- **Speed** (yellow) — modulates LFO rate through zero, so the waveform inverts and speeds up again with negative CV
- **Phase** (pink) — modulates the LFO phase directly
- **Amplitude** (cyan) — modulates output attenuation
- **Reset** (red) — resets the LFO phase on a rising edge above 1V; attenuation and mute state affect the detection threshold

#### Waveform and output

Press **Button 2** to cycle through waveforms: sine (yellow), triangle (pink), ramp down (cyan), ramp up (red), square (white). **Shift + Fader 2** adjusts output attenuation. **Long press** (no shift) on Button 2 mutes the LFO output.

#### Clocked mode

**Shift + long press** on Button 2 toggles between free-running and tempo-synced modes. In clocked mode, available resolutions are: 16th, 8thT, 8th, 4thT, 4th, 2nd, note, half bar, and bar. The **Speed** parameter applies a global multiplier—Normal, Slow (÷2), Slowest (÷4)—in both modes. Output can be bipolar (−5V to +5V) or unipolar (0V to 10V), setting the MIDI CC center to 64 or 0 respectively.

#### Grid Lock

**Grid Lock only has an effect in clocked mode.** When enabled (default on), the LFO phase is continuously derived from the clock's absolute tick count, keeping it locked to the grid regardless of when the LFO was started. Changing the speed division re-aligns automatically, but this can cause a click as the LFO jumps to its recalculated position.

A **Shift + short press** on Button 2, or a rising-edge gate when the CV input is in reset mode, offsets the phase reference to the current tick for deliberate phase-offset effects. A clock reset re-locks to the grid.

Disabling Grid Lock reverts to free-running phase accumulation: the LFO will smoothly speed up or slow down from its current position when the division changes, with no jump.`,

Grids is described as a "topographic drum sequencer" - it generates a variety of drum patterns based on continuous interpolation through a "map" of patterns (Drum Mode) or using Euclidean algorithms (Euclidean Mode).  The original Mutable Instruments module manual is [here](https://pichenettes.github.io/mutable-instruments-documentation/modules/grids/manual/).

* FP-Grids outputs CV gates (0V = off, 10V = on) and, optionally MIDI note on/off messages, with normal and accented velocity levels.

#### Drums Output Mode

Generates patterns by interpolating through a 2D map of pre-analyzed drum patterns. Sequence length is always 32 steps at 1/32nd note resolution.

* **Map X / Map Y:** Controls the position on the pattern map. Small changes typically result in related rhythmic variations.
* **Density 1 / Density 2 / Density 3:** Controls the event density (fill) for each of the three main trigger outputs.
* **Chaos Amount:** Controls the amount of randomness applied. When set to a high value, rolls / ghost notes will be randomly added to the pattern.
* **Global Accent:** The 4th channel provides a global accent CV gate that can be used for triggering other voices or envelopes. This combines the accents from the individual three drum voices in the original Grids firmware into a single mixed Accent signal.

#### Euclidean Output Mode

Generates classic Euclidean rhythms for each of the three main trigger outputs independently.

* **Length 1 / Length 2 / Length 3:** Sets the total number of steps in the sequence for each output (1-16). Set with Shift + Fader.
* **Fill 1 / Fill 2 / Fill 3:** Main faders set the number of active beats from 0 to the current Length for each channel.
* **Offset 1 / Offset 2 / Offset 3:** While holding Shift, press channel buttons 1-3 to rotate each Euclidean pattern by one step.
* **Chaos Amount:** Controls the probability of randomly flipping a beat on or off each step.
* **Clock Division:** Shift + Fader 4 sets the step resolution (default 1/16th note).
* While Shift is held in Euclidean mode, channel buttons light pink to indicate offset control.

#### DnB Mode (Easter Egg)

A drum and bass pattern generator with 12 preset kick/snare/hi-hat patterns and probabilistic triggering. Cycle through output modes with Shift + Button 4 until the LED shows sand/amber.

* **Outputs:** Kick, Snare, Hats and Ghost Snare CV gates and MIDI notes
* **Kick / Snare / Ghost Snare:** Faders 1, 2, and 4 set the trigger probability for each voice (0 = never, full = always).
* **Pattern select:** Fader 3 selects one of 12 DnB patterns. The pattern changes take effect at the start of the next bar.
* **Vary pattern:** Shift + Button 1 randomly mutates the current pattern.
* **Restore pattern:** Shift + Button 2 restores the pattern to the last selected base pattern.
* Clock division is set automatically by the selected pattern — Fader 4 Alt (resolution) has no effect in this mode.
* The Ghost Snare uses the the "DnB Ghost Note MIDI Note" and MIDI Channel, at a reduced velocity.

#### Patch Ideas

* Try saving different Scenes with different Output Modes, then switching between scenes in a performance (sequence will reset on next step).
* The sequencers can be reset rhythmically by patching an external trigger into one of the Faderpunk Aux Jacks (configured as a reset input).

TB-3PO is a deterministic acid bass pattern generator, ported from the TB-3PO Hemisphere applet by Logarhythm/djphazer. It generates TB-303-style patterns — complete with gates, accents, and octave shifts — from a single 16-bit seed value. Because patterns are fully deterministic, the same seed always produces the same sequence, making it easy to recall and lock in a favourite groove.

#### Pattern Generation

Every pattern is generated in two passes from the current seed and density:

1. **Pitch pass:** assigns scale degrees (0–8) and octave-up/down flags to each of 32 steps. Higher density means more pitch variety and fewer repeated notes.
2. **Gate/accent pass:** rolls gate and accent probability for each step. Accents cluster similarly to a real 303.

The quantizer maps all pitch output to the system-wide scale and root, so TB-3PO stays in key across your whole patch.

#### Outputs

* **Ch 1 (Jack 0):** Pitch CV (0–10V, 1V/oct)
* **Ch 2 (Jack 1):** Gate
* **Ch 3 (Jack 2):** Accent CV (high when accented, 0 otherwise)

#### Faders

* **Fader 1 (Density):** Controls pattern density and pitch variety simultaneously. At low values the pattern is sparse and monotone; at high values it is dense and chromatically varied. While Button 1 is held, Fader 1 selects the clock resolution (whole note down to fast 32nds).
* **Fader 2 (Length):** Sets the sequence length from 1 to 32 steps.
* **Fader 3 (Transpose):** Transposes the entire pattern ±24 semitones. Hold Shift while moving Fader 3 to shift by whole octaves (−4 to +4). Both offsets are summed and stored independently.

#### Buttons

* **Button 1 — short press:** Re-seeds the pattern. A new seed is grabbed from the internal tick counter, immediately generating a fresh pattern and resetting the step counter.
* **Button 2 — short press:** Toggles accents on/off. Button lit mid = accents active; button dim = accents suppressed (accent CV stays 0, MIDI fires at normal velocity).
* **Button 3 — short press:** Mutes or unmutes the output. Mute is inhibit-only: the current note rings out naturally (gate closes at end of the step), pitch CV holds its last value, and no new gates open until unmuted.

#### Clock & Re-seeding

On a clock **Reset**, the step counter resets to step 1 — the pattern is not changed. On a clock **Stop**, the gate closes and any held MIDI note is killed.

#### LED Feedback

* **Ch 1 Top:** Density level as brightness (user color)
* **Ch 1 Bottom:** While Button 1 is held (resolution mode), flashes in sync with the current clock division — orange for straight divisions, blue for triplets.
* **Ch 1 Button:** Mid brightness (user color); flashes white on each reseed.
* **Ch 2 Top:** Gate open indicator (user color)
* **Ch 2 Bottom:** Step progress — bright at step 1, dims toward the end of the sequence
* **Ch 2 Button:** Mid brightness = accents active; dim = accents suppressed
* **Ch 3 Top:** Orange when an accented gate is firing
* **Ch 3 Bottom:** Transpose distance from center — dim = centered (no offset), bright = far from center
* **Ch 3 Button:** Lit = unmuted; dim = muted

    text: `The Automator is an automation recorder. To record a loop hold the button while moving the fader and release to lock it in as a repeating loop. After recording the loop the fader becomes an offset to the output CV. Like in most apps shift + fader is an attenuator, in this case the attenuation only affects the recorded CV allowing you to introduce this modulation gradually.

**A clock is required.** Without a clock the fader passes through to the output but recording is disabled and the button does nothing.

#### Recording a loop

Hold the button and move the fader. The LED turns red while you hold. Both the recording start and end are quantized to the nearest 16th-note, the loop length equals the button hold duration. If the maximum recording length is reached, the recording stops automatically and the loop starts playing. Hold the button again to replace the loop. Press Shift + Button to clear the loop and return to passthrough.

#### Loop controls

While a loop is running, the fader adds a bipolar offset to the loop. Center leaves the loop unmodified; pushing up raises the output, pulling down lowers it. Hold Shift and move the fader to set the attenuation level, in this case the attenuation only affects the recorded CV allowing you to introduce this modulation gradually. The button LED turns white for one tick at the start of each loop cycle. Both offset and attenuation are saved with the loop.

#### Persistence

The loop, its length, offset, and attenuation are saved to memory and restored on power-up. Loops are saved and recalled per scene.

#### Resolution

The resolution parameter controls how many samples are recorded per bar. Higher values give finer resolution but shorten the maximum loop length. Lower values allow longer loops at the cost of playback resolution. The CV is interpolated between samples`,

Both evolve slowly each cycle, so the melody and rhythm drift together over time. Legato and accents are derived automatically from the same TMs, so the whole sequence, melody, rhythm, slides and accents, come from just two seeds.

#### Register lengths

Hold Shift and tap Button 1 or Button 2 to count out a TM length (1–16 steps); release Shift to commit. The button LED brightens with each tap and shows the stored value before you start counting. If the length of the length TM is set to 1 then the euclidean generator behaves the same as a standard one with Fader 2 controlling the length and Fader 3 the pulse count.

#### Mute

Mute is inhibit-only. Tapping Button 3 stops new gates from opening and holds the CV at its last value, but the current note rings out naturally. Holding Button 3 to access the third layer does not toggle mute.

#### Scene recall

On load, both registers are restored at the next phrase boundary so the recalled sequence re-enters in time.`,

    text: `Super LFO is a two-channel form LFO: continuous **waveform morph**, **symmetry**, soft **skew**, **phase-warp**, internal **rate modulation**, and **dual oscillators** mixed with Xfade / Min / Max / Sum.

#### Sound / form

- **Morph (Left Fader)** sweeps Sine → Triangle → Saw → Square → Random walk → Sample & hold → Noise.
- **Attenuation (Shift + Left Fader)** scales output level (Amp). Rate-mod depth is a separate stored value modulated when **CV Dest = Rate Mod**.
- **Skew (Button + Left Fader)** soft asymmetry via a power curve (center ≈ linear).
- **Symmetry (Right Fader)** leans cycle halves via phase remap (center = balanced).
- **Phase-Warp (Button + Right Fader)** eases time through the cycle without changing the base rate.
- **Speed (Shift + Right Fader)** sets LFO rate. Configurator **Speed** (Normal / Slow / Slowest) divides by 1 / 2 / 4.

#### Dual oscillators

**Osc B = Quad** — B is +90° from A. **Osc B = Octave** — B runs at 2× phase. **Mix balance** 0–100% (default 50%): 0% = A only, 100% = B only (**Xfade** only; Min / Max / Sum ignore balance). **Shift + Left long press** cycles mix mode on-device.

**CV Dest** (Configurator or **Shift + Left short press**) picks what CV In modulates: Rate Mod (blue), Phase (pink), Reset (red), Amp (cyan), Speed (yellow), Morph (orange), Skew (violet), Warp (green), Symmetry (rose).

#### Layout

| | Fader | Shift + Fader | Button + Fader |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Left (CV In)** | Morph | Attenuation | Skew |
| **Right (CV Out)** | Symmetry | Speed | Phase-Warp |

#### Gestures

| Control | Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Left short press** | Freeze (hold phase + output) |
| **Left long press** | Mute CV in |
| **Shift + Left short press** | Cycle CV destination |
| **Shift + Left long press** | Cycle dual-osc mix mode |
| **Right short press** | Phase reset |
| **Right long press** | Mute CV out |
| **Shift + Right short press** | Phase reverse |
| **Shift + Right long press** | Clock sync |

**Grid Lock** (clocked mode only) behaves like the stock LFO — see the LFO app manual for details.`,

#### Delay and feedback

**Fader** sets delay time (up = shorter). **Delay mode** ms uses **Max delay (ms)** as the ceiling; Clock mode maps the fader to bar divisions (16 bars down to 1 tick). **Shift + Fader** sets feedback. **Button + Fader** sets pitch interval in semitones; **Interval mode** Fixed / Stack / Bounce shapes how repeats transpose.

    text: `Arp de Lévy is a one-channel generative arpeggiator. It keeps a persistent note pool and walks it with **Lévy-flight** steps — mostly small melodic moves (1–3 semitones), occasionally a larger jump — so the phrase evolves without turning into white-noise pitch. CV (1V/oct, quantized unless **Bypass quantizer**) and MIDI note fire together on each hit. **V/Oct** selects Eurorack 1V/oct or Buchla 1.2V/oct scaling.

#### Mutation, texture, and flight

Mutation rate freezes the pool at the bottom and applies more Lévy edits at each phrase boundary as you raise it. Texture jointly moves density (rests), phrase length (from 16 steps down to 4), and swing — sparse/long/straight at the bottom, dense/short/swung toward the top. **Button + Fader** sets Lévy **α** (local ↔ wild jump character).

#### Expression

There is no dedicated fader for expression. **Short press** (and CV Dest = Reroll) re-rolls the note pool **and** picks a new **expression depth**. That depth controls how much each subsequent note jitters in **velocity** and **gate length** around a fixed base (half-step gate, ~78% velocity). Depth 0 = fixed notes; high depth = more random long/loud variation per hit.

#### Gestures

| Control | Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Fader** | Mutation rate (0 = freeze loop) |
| **Shift + Fader** | Texture macro (density + phrase length + swing) |
| **Button + Fader** | Lévy α (local ↔ wild) |
| **Short press** | Reroll pool + expression depth; reset phrase |
| **Long press** | Mute (no fader move) |
| **Shift + short** | Reverse playback |
| **Shift + long** | Cycle octave span 1→2→3→4 |

#### Faders & LEDs

| **Fader** | Mutation | **Top LED** = phrase progress in app color. **Bottom LED** flashes on each hit |
| **Shift + Fader** | Texture | **Top LED** = texture in **orange** (brighter = denser/shorter) |

    text: `Chord Vamp plays MIDI chord progressions in two modes. **Perform**: scrub a **pitch map** of the genre's unique degrees across ~3 octaves and **hold** the button to sound the chord. **Auto**: a genre **rhythm phrase** (weighted hits + multi-bar rests) loops on the clock while harmony **Repeats** or **Meanders**; **short press** play/pauses. Toggle modes with **Shift + short press**.

#### Perform and capture

In Perform, **Shift + short press** captures the last N bars of harmony (per **Capture length**: 16 / 8 / 4 / 2 / 1 bars) into a timed clip, switches to Auto, and starts playback. Chord *starts* snap to the 16th grid; empty lead-in is cropped so the first hit lands on the loop downbeat; hold lengths stay free. **Perform long press** is unused — the chord stays held while the button is down (LEDs go blue and track pitch).

In Auto, **long press** clears the capture clip and reseeds the genre phrase. **Shift + long press** panics (All Notes Off). **Shift + short press** returns to Perform.

#### Groove

- **Feel** (**Button + Fader**): laid back ↔ advanced — scales Auto hit lengths and Capture playback durations. Rests stay Feel-independent (genre multi-bar breaks).
- **Swing** (scene storage, seeded from genre): delays odd 16ths on Auto hits and Capture playback. Resets to the genre default when you pick/reseed a genre. Stacks with global Scene+Fader 15 clock swing — keep one near zero if the feel gets muddy.

#### Faders

- **Perform — Main**: scrub genre degrees × octaves (low → high).
- **Auto — Main**: tension (Meander harmonic drift; ignored in Repeat).
- **Shift + Fader**: genre (Dub → … → Dubstep; rose = Capture clip slot when a clip exists).
- **Button + Fader**: Feel (hit length / Capture dur scale). Auto+Hold LEDs are rose and show phrase position; Perform+Hold LEDs are blue and track chord pitch.

**CV Dest** Macro modulates scrub (Perform) or tension (Auto). Panic can fire from CV when **CV Dest = Panic**. Perform mode uses app color on the button; Auto uses orange (bright = playing).`,
