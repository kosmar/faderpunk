    <H2 id="configurator">Faderpunk Configurator</H2>
    <p>
      <strong>The Configurator is a core component of Faderpunk.</strong>
      <br />
      It's the tool you'll use to create app layouts, edit app parameters, and
      modify internal settings of the Faderpunk device.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Configurator connects to your Faderpunk using{" "}
      <strong>Web MIDI</strong>, a browser API for talking to MIDI devices. Most
      modern browsers support it.
    </p>

    <H3 id="compatible-browsers">Compatible Browsers with Web MIDI Support:</H3>
    <List>
      <li>Google Chrome</li>
      <li>Microsoft Edge</li>
      <li>Mozilla Firefox</li>
      <li>Brave</li>
      <li>Vivaldi</li>
    </List>
    <p>
      <strong>Safari does not support Web MIDI</strong> and can't be used to
      connect to a Faderpunk.
    </p>

    <p>
      To get started, open a compatible browser and visit{" "}
      <a className="font-semibold underline" href="https://faderpunk.io">
        https://faderpunk.io
      </a>
      .
      <br />
      Click <strong>"Connect Device"</strong>. The first time you connect, your
      browser will ask permission to allow MIDI (SysEx) access — click{" "}
      <strong>Allow</strong>. There's no device picker to navigate: once
      permission is granted, the Configurator automatically finds your Faderpunk
      among the available MIDI ports.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once connected, you'll be greeted by the Configurator interface, which
      consists of <strong>three tabs</strong>:
    </p>
    <List>
      <li>
        <strong>Device Tab</strong> – Edit the layout and adjust parameters of
        the apps loaded in your configuration.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Apps Tab</strong> – Choose which apps to include in your layout.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Settings Tab</strong> – Modify global configurations of the
        Faderpunk device.
      </li>
    </List>

    <H3 id="device-tab">Device Tab</H3>

    <img
      className="my-6"
      alt="Screenshot of the device overview in the Faderpunk configurator"
      src="/img/configurator-device.png"
    />

    <p>The Device tab is divided into two sections:</p>

    <H4>Channel Overview</H4>
    <p>
      At the top, you'll find the <strong>Channel Overview</strong>, which
      provides a visual representation of the apps currently loaded on your
      Faderpunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clicking on this graphic opens the <strong>Edit Layout</strong> interface.
      Here, you can drag and drop apps to assign them to different channels.
      Clicking on an app within the layout editor allows you to{" "}
      <strong>remove</strong> it from the layout.
    </p>
    <p>
      To confirm your changes, click <strong>Save</strong>. This extra step
      helps prevent accidental modifications and loss of work.
      <br />
      Clicking <strong>Save</strong> will apply the new layout, while{" "}
      <strong>Cancel</strong> will discard the changes and return you to the
      main Device tab.
    </p>

    <H4>Active Apps</H4>
    <p>This section lets you edit the parameters of each loaded app.</p>
    <p>
      All apps currently installed on your Faderpunk are listed here in order.
      Each entry displays the app's name, its assigned channel, and the number
      of slots it occupies.
    </p>
    <p>
      To edit an app's parameters, simply click on it. A menu will appear below,
      allowing you to adjust its settings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just like with the layout, you must click <strong>Save</strong> to apply
      changes to each individual app. This safeguard ensures that no unintended
      modifications are made.
    </p>

    <H3 id="apps-tab">Apps Tab</H3>

    <img
      className="my-6"
      alt="Screenshot of the apps tab in the Faderpunk configurator"
      src="/img/configurator-apps.png"
    />

    <p>
      The Apps tab is where you select the apps you'd like to include in your
      layout. Like the Device tab, it consists of two sections:
    </p>

    <H4>Channel Overview</H4>
    <p>
      This section is identical to the one in the Device tab. It provides a
      visual representation of your current layout and allows you to rearrange
      apps across channels.
    </p>

    <H4>Available Apps List</H4>
    <p>
      Apps are listed here in order of the number of channels they use, followed
      by alphabetical order.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clicking on an app opens the <strong>Add App</strong> pop-up, where you
      can place the selected app into your layout. This pop-up also displays:
    </p>
    <List>
      <li>The app's available parameters</li>
      <li>The number of channels it occupies</li>
      <li>A link to the app's manual</li>
    </List>
    <p>
      Within the Add App interface, you can drag and drop not only the new app
      but also the apps already loaded on your Faderpunk. This allows for
      flexible layout adjustments.
    </p>
    <p>
      If there are no available channels for the selected app, you'll see the
      message:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>
        "I can't find space for the app. Try to remove apps or move them
        around."
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      In this case, you can rearrange or delete apps just as you would in the
      Edit Layout pop-up.
    </p>

    <H3 id="settings-tab">Settings Tab</H3>

    <img
      className="my-6"
      alt="Screenshot of the settings tab in the Faderpunk configurator"
      src="/img/configurator-settings.png"
    />

    <p>
      In this tab, you can edit the <strong>global parameters</strong> of your
      Faderpunk device.
    </p>

    <H4 id="settings-clock">Clock Section</H4>
    <p>Here you can configure the clock behavior:</p>
    <List>
      <li>
        <strong>Clock Source</strong>: Choose between:
        <List>
          <li>Internal</li>

    <p>Refer to each app's manual to check if it uses the global quantizer.</p>

    <H4 id="settings-midi">MIDI</H4>
    <p>
      Here you can configure which MIDI data is transmitted to each MIDI output,
      essentially allowing Faderpunk to function as a MIDI router. You can also
      choose whether the clock—configured in the <strong>CLOCK</strong>{" "}
      section—is sent to each output.
    </p>

    <List>
      <li>
        <strong>None</strong>
      </li>
      No MIDI is sent to this output.
      <li>
        <strong>Local</strong>
      </li>
      Only MIDI generated by the <strong>apps</strong> is sent to this output.
      <li>
        <strong>MIDI Thru</strong>
      </li>
      Only MIDI received from the selected source is forwarded to this output.
      <li>
        <strong>MIDI Merge</strong>
      </li>
      Both MIDI generated by the <strong>apps</strong> and MIDI received from
      the selected source are sent to this output.
    </List>

    <H4 id="settings-i2c">I²C Configuration</H4>
    <p>
      Faderpunk can operate as either a <strong>Leader</strong> or{" "}
      <strong>Follower</strong> on the I²C bus.
      <br />
      You can set this behavior in the Settings tab.
    </p>

    <H4 id="settings-aux">AUX Jacks</H4>
    <p>
      Configure AUX jacks as <strong>clock outputs</strong> or{" "}
      <strong>reset outputs</strong>.

    <H4 id="settings-voct">Custom V/Oct Calibration</H4>
    <p>
      Faderpunk stores up to{" "}
      <strong>four custom V/Oct calibration curves</strong> (Custom 1–4). This
      allows Faderpunk to achieve near-perfect tracking with any V/Oct
      oscillator, regardless of the calibration of either the target oscillator
      or the Faderpunk itself. It can even allow oscillators that are not
      designed to run on 1V/Oct to track with the pitched apps on Faderpunk.
      Once calibrated, any app that has a <strong>1V/Oct</strong> parameter can
      use one of the custom curves instead of the default standard tracking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each curve shows its measured gain next to the curve name (e.g.,{" "}
      <em>0.998 V/Oct</em>), or <em>Not calibrated</em> if no measurement has
      been taken yet. Click <strong>Calibrate</strong> next to a curve to open
      the calibration wizard. The wizard offers two modes:{" "}
      <strong>Automated</strong>, where Faderpunk measures the VCO frequency
      itself via an AUX jack, and <strong>Manual</strong>, where you read the
      frequency off an external tuner.
    </p>
    <H5>What you need</H5>
    <List>
      <li>
        A VCO with a V/Oct input connected to one of the 16 Faderpunk output
        jacks
      </li>
      <li>
        For Automated mode: the VCO audio output connected to one of the three
        AUX jacks (Atom, Meteor, or Cube) — Faderpunk measures the frequency
        itself
      </li>
      <li>
        For Manual mode: a tuner with a frequency meter (hardware or software)
        connected to the VCO audio output
      </li>
    </List>
    <p>
      If an app is currently assigned to the output jack you calibrate on,
      Faderpunk temporarily evicts it for the duration of the calibration and
      restores it automatically afterward — there's no need to free up the jack
      first.
    </p>
    <H5>Automated calibration wizard</H5>
    <List>
      <li>
        <strong>Setup</strong> — Select <strong>Automated</strong>, the
        Faderpunk output jack connected to the VCO V/Oct input, and the AUX jack
        connected to the VCO audio output. Click <strong>Start</strong>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1V measurement</strong> — Faderpunk outputs 1V and measures the
        frequency on the AUX jack automatically.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>4V measurement</strong> — Faderpunk outputs 4V and measures
        again. The V/Oct gain is calculated from the two readings.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Confirm</strong> — Faderpunk outputs one calibrated octave above
        1V and re-measures automatically, showing the deviation in cents. Click{" "}
        <strong>Save</strong> if the result looks accurate, or{" "}
        <strong>Recalibrate</strong> to start again.
      </li>
    </List>
    <H5>Manual calibration wizard</H5>
    <List>
      <li>
        <strong>Setup</strong> — Select <strong>Manual</strong> and the
        Faderpunk output jack connected to the VCO V/Oct input. Click{" "}
        <strong>Start</strong>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1V measurement</strong> — Faderpunk outputs 1V. Read the
        frequency from your tuner and enter it, then click <strong>Next</strong>
        .
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>4V measurement</strong> — Faderpunk outputs 4V. Read the new
        frequency from your tuner and enter it, then click{" "}
        <strong>Calculate</strong>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Confirm</strong> — The calculated V/Oct gain is displayed. Click{" "}
        <strong>Save</strong> to store the calibration, or{" "}
        <strong>Recalibrate</strong> to start again.
      </li>
    </List>
    <p>
      The calibration is saved into the device's global configuration. It
      survives power cycles and is included when you export a setup file. Apps
      that use the calibrated curve automatically apply the correction without
      needing to be reconfigured.
